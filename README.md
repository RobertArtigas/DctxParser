# DctxParser
Very Simple Clarion Dctx Parser Featuring Capesoft's xFiles

Hello,

I put this little app together for a Clarion community member as one way of parsing a Dctx file.

I make no warranty, either expressed, or implied, that it is the best or correct way to parse a Dctx file. :-)

Feel free to download the files and modify as you see fit.

Thank you!



Clarion 11.0.13505
StringTheory 3.35
xFiles 3.21
